- common bool mechanism from command line
- jcard string should be variable?

- non-multiple: the last item wins, and a warning should be given if the option was found (-strict should return error instead)
- multiple options must be added ONLY with -add-

- add multipledStructured example
- add function to shift each line of help by correct formatting spaces


> -h, -help, --help: print this message and exit.
> -helpToHtml:  print all available options in HTML format (options.html) and exit.

- print defaults mechanism missing
- general debug option -debug=string
- command line parsing is missing
- help and search mechanism, through names and descriptions


- unit testing:

simple w/o jcard
simple with jcard with one default
simple with jcard with no default
simple with jcard with no default with gdebug
