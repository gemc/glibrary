- printing defaults should be part of a goption option
- gverbosity should be part of a goption option

the two aboves can be fixed

- command line parsing is missing
- help mechanism
- verbosity mechanism: add default in the constructor? Seems confusing right now
- search mechanism, through names and descriptions
