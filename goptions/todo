- bool mechanism is not JSON but command line

- groupable: should be "multiple", structuredExample should have one item not multiple
  in this case last item wins, and a warning should be given if the option was found (-strict should return error instead)

- add multipledStructured example


> -h, -help, --help: print this message and exit.
> -helpToHtml:  print all available options in HTML format (options.html) and exit.

print default mechanism missing

- general debug option -debug=string
- command line parsing is missing
- helpa nd search mechanism, through names and descriptions


- check structured example: looks like it's automatically groupable
