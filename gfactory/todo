Notice: to run the examples we need to link the dynamic libraries to the glibrary naming convention: the extension is .gplugin

ln -s libfordFactory.dylib fordFactory.gplugin
ln -s libdodgeFactory.dylib dodgeFactory.gplugin


- redo doxygen

- provide time spent by each plugin?
- provide message is symbol cannot be loaded
- GDL: add verbosity option?
- add error if DL is not found, with msg
- add mutex so we can use verbosity cout? see http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/shared_ptr
