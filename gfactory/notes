Notice: to run the examples we need to link the dynamic libraries to the glibrary naming convention: the extension is .gplugin

ln -s libfordFactory.dylib  fordFactory.gplugin
ln -s libteslaFactory.dylib teslaFactory.gplugin


// the gdl header is based on this tutorial:
// https://0x00sec.org/t/c-dynamic-loading-of-shared-objects-at-runtime/1498

// the gfactory code is based on TheComet tutorial here:
// https://www.gamedev.net/topic/683154-c-extend-class-in-dll/
