Note: the scons gplugin CANNOT be used when running xcode to load the gplugins, and viceversa

The comments below do not apply if scons is used.

xcode notes:
############

Notice 1: to run the examples we need to link or mv the dynamic libraries to the glibrary naming convention to be loaded correctly:
the extension is .gplugin

Notice 2: do not do this through finder! It will keep dylib

ln -s libfordFactory.dylib  fordFactory.gplugin
ln -s libteslaFactory.dylib teslaFactory.gplugin
