## Automatic travis push to github

- In GitHub account, go to settings and Personal access tokens
- Click Generate a new token and fill in the description. e.g. <REPO NAME> Travis CI Documentation
- If the repository is public select as scope public_repo. If your repository is private select as scope repo.
- Notice: it's better to generate one token per repo otherwise one would have to keep tokens for multiple repos in sync between github and travis.
- Click Generate token
- Copy the generated token
- Notice: if we re-generate the token we need to copy to each travis build, see below


- In Travis CI, go to the repository settings. If setting option is not present, we need to activate the repo:
  Travis account settings > click on the organization and "manage repositories"
- In the Environment Variables section write in the Name field GH_REPO_TOKEN
- Past the copied token in the Value field
- Make sure that the Display value in build log is switched off
- Click on Add

Create the gh-page branch:

git checkout --orphan gh-pages
git commit -m "First commit"
git push origin gh-pages
git rm -rf .
git commit -m "Clean start"
git push origin gh-pages
git checkout master


To add repository to this travis:

Inside https://travis-ci.com:
