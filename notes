In general from scratch:

- new project
- remove project file from folder, put one dir up
- target: add library or command line executable, remove dirs/files created, add files to build phases manually
- add settings.xconfig to target settings
- Build Active Architecture only: yes
- debug info: DWARF
- Enable Testability: yes
- make sure Deployment target version is deleted (this will revert it to default) on both projects and settings. 


## Create project:

- Start with with  Cross-platform Empty project: "COMMAND-SHIFT-N". Do no create local git repos.
- Close it. Move the project from  its own dir created to one dir up. Delete dir.
- Add all the files (make sure to do scons -c to avoid including objects). Added folders: Create groups (create folder reference won't let add sources later)
- On the general project add "settings.xcconfig" configuration for debug and release
- Add macos Library target "libraryName". Dynamic. Currently 2 type of "Library" targets, choose second one, make sure it's STL C++
- remove libraryName directory
- add sources libraryName.cc in Compile Sources "Build Phases"
- make sure the scheme is set to build "Release" so that archiving build the exact same way as normal build
- unless there is a developer account, everything should be signed to run locally
- disable "Hardened Runtime" to allow non signed code (both debug and release)
- also, in Signing and Capabilities, disable library validation
- notice: test scheme should also be release
- make sure any needed library is "linked to" and not "embedded" in the frameworks
- Publish Your App With Symbol Information: add dSYM file so the symbols are kept in the crash reports (for example testflights). However this is only useful if we have different xcode versions. See: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-your-app-to-include-debugging-information/
- for executables: Add macos command line tool exampleName

## Gstreamer prefix/suffix xcode:

- Build Settings > Executable Prefix set to empty
- Build Settings > Executable Extension set to gplugin

## Add explicit FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS:

FRAMEWORK_SEARCH_PATHS = $QTFRAMES

## After versions update:

- May have to clean LIBRARY_SEARCH as it may point to wrong version dirs



## Cocoa plugin not found

Add $QTDIR/plugins/ explicit, currently: /opt/jlab_software/2.5/Darwin_macosx12.3.1-clang13.1.6/qt/system/clang_64/plugins/
to scheme environment var QT_PLUGIN_PATH

- if problems with plugin "cocoa":
* can set QT_DEBUG_PLUGINS to 1 in the env variables for more debugging
* can set QT_PLUGIN_PATH to plugin locations (cocoa plugin is under platforms there), currently /opt/jlab_software/2.4/Darwin_macosx10.15-clang12.0.0/qt/system/clang_64/plugins


## QT Widgets

QWidgets that are newed can be given a parent.
When the parent is destroyed, all of its children will be destroyed.
Hence, in Qt it is common practice to allocate objects on the stack with new, give them a parent, and never delete the memory yourself.
Also, when you add widgets to the layout, it reparents them to the widget the layout has been set on.

## QT Resources

resources could be the executable name to retrieve the path, for example argv[0]:

QFileInfo qrcFileInfoExecutable(argv[0]);
QString rccPath = qrcFileInfoExecutable.absolutePath() + "/" + "gemcResources.rcc";
QResource::registerResource(rccPath);

The rcc file (i.e. gemcResources.rcc) is obtained with:
rcc -binary exampleResources.qrc -o exampleResources.rcc

In xcode:

Solution 1:

add to the rcc file to the project and copy it in product directory
scons on the other hand knows about it because the qt module
compiles exampleResources.qrc directly

Solution 2:

In xcode: change type of qrc file to "C++ Source"

Select your project target and in Build Rules make a new custom rule ("+" button).
Set the "Process" drop down to "Source files with names matching" and type in *.qrc next to that.
Set the "Using" drop down to "Custom script:" and in the script type (find path to rcc):

$QTDIR/bin/rcc -name ${INPUT_FILE_BASE} ${INPUT_FILE_PATH} -o ${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/qrc_${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.cc

Now add the "Output files" ("+" button):

${DERIVED_FILE_DIR}/qrc_${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.cc


## Using Namespace std

- never in headers
- can use std::cout 
- can be inside scopes



## Shared schemes:

Shared schemes are stored in <.xcodeproj or .xcworkspace file>/xcshareddata/xcschemes/.
A shared scheme is visible to all users of a project or workspace file.
We do not need it at the moment.
