G4 libraries needed for the library:

- graphics_reps
- digits_hits
- global

For the example:
- global
- track
- gtouchable



Notice: I had to add arm64 to  Project -> Build Settings -> Excluded Architecture


- Allows for different color schema for different detectors


- this is a standalone library cause it's worth to have its dedicated doxy build
